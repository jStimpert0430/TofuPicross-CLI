# TofuPicross-CLI
TofuPicross-CLI is a picross styled game program written for a bash terminal. Created as a means to indentify back end game logic for use in the 
ElePicross(https://github.com/jStimpert0430/ElePicross) project, to get some c++ practice, and just because picross in a terminal is a fun project.
